##  What does it do?

Crashlytics helps you to collect analytics and details about crashes and errors that occur in your app. It does this through three aspects:

- **Logs**: Log events in your app to be sent with the crash report for context if your app crashes.
- **Crash reports**: Every crash is automatically turned into a crash report and sent.
- **Stack traces**: Even when an error is caught and your app recovers, the JavaScript stack trace can still be sent.

  firebase_crashlytics: "^{{ plugins.firebase_crashlytics }}"
```

### 2. Download dependency

```
$ flutter pub get
```

### 3. Platform Integration

#### a. Android

1. Add the following classpaths to the `/android/build.gradle` file.

```dart
dependencies {
  // ... other dependencies
  classpath 'com.google.firebase:firebase-crashlytics-gradle:2.2.0'
}
```

3. Apply the following plugins to the `/android/app/build.gradle` file.

```dart
apply plugin: 'com.google.firebase.crashlytics'

dependencies {
  // ... other dependencies
  implementation 'com.google.firebase:firebase-crashlytics:17.1.1'

  implementation 'com.google.firebase:firebase-analytics:17.4.4'
}
```

#### b. iOS

1. From Xcode select `Runner` from the project navigation.
2. Select the `Build Phases` tab.
3. Click `+ Add a new build phase`, and select `New Run Script Phase`.
4. Add `${PODS_ROOT}/Fabric/run` to the `Type a script...` text box.
5. If you are using Xcode 10, add the location of `Info.plist`, built by your app, to the `Build Phase's Input Files` field.
E.g.: `$(BUILT_PRODUCTS_DIR)/$(INFOPLIST_PATH)`

### 3. Rebuild your app

Once complete, rebuild your Flutter application:

```bash
$ flutter run
```
